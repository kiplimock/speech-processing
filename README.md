## Speech Processing

 I am learning how to use various python libraries for speech processing and I find them useful for my MSc in Electrical Engineering. These are:
 1. `librosa`
 2. `sound device`
 3. `matplotlib`
 4. `pandas`
 5. `numpy`
 6. `Scipy`

I will be posting my code here regularly. Part of the work yo can expect to see in weeks ahead are reproductions of experiments performed by researchers and published in IEEE journal articles.

Too early to say this, but feel free to "Fork me"!
