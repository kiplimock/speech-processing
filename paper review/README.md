## EEE 6111 Speech Processing
### Python Notebook submitted with a paper review report on Formant-Based VAD

Experiments reproduced:
•	Transforming the audio file into frequency domain using FFT algorithm.
•	Performing a neighbor search to identify new peak location in case of variation.
•	Performing the PND algorithm and applying weights to the results.
•	Comparison of the weighted PND values to the threshold.
•	Vowel identification in sections of the audio file.
